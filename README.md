## Rat-In-Maze
A terminal based maze game.
The program deals with the creation, solving and playing with mazes.

---
##### It mainly consists of two parts,

1. Provide a Maze : 
In this portion of the program, the user is  allowed to provide the maze, for which the program solves the maze for user.
* Further "providing maze" presents user with two choices - "Creation of own Maze(By user)" and "Pick from available ones(provided by program)".
* In the "Creation of own Maze(By user)", the user is allowed to create his/her own maze with how much ever size(Rows x Cols) which he/she wishes.
* In "Pick from available ones(provided by program)" portion, user is supposed to choose from pre-defined mazes presented by the program.

Overall, if the user chooses any of the two options, the program goes through the maze in recursive manner and finds the solution.



2. Play Maze Challenge : 
In this portion, the user is given with pre-defined mazes and he/she has to choose a maze and solve it.
The difficulty level of the program increases in ascending fashion.

Probably, people think that mazes will be represented by 0's/1's and the open/close path with some special characters.
But when you run our program there's no binary digits involved in the maze, i.e., the 0's/1's maze is totally encoded to a ASCII character and its visually similar to normal mazes.
Doubly Linked List, encoding, recursion, two-dimensional arrays, etc are the main features of this program.
So, with all these features and with the knowledge of the data structures and algorithmic notions, we've developed this game.
